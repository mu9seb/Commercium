# Luminary Collective

My first capstone project in the LearnToCode Academy. We were tasked with creating an e-commerce website, however I am more interested in offering a service beyond any mere monetary value, the highest good if you will. Thus spawn the title of my website, the Luminary Collective which will host a movement towards conscious excellence.
